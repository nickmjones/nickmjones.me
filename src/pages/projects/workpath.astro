          I redesigned and redeveloped Workpath's marketing site, designed marketing and sales materials, established new brand guidelines, and developed a design kit for future use.

      <p>Some of my first meetings with Workpath were about where they were and where they wanted to be. It was important for them that people know that the platform was easy to use, but was also a secure place for customer data. That was a sharp contrast from the spreadsheets and text messages that many home health teams relied on. I wanted to put a prospect at the center of a working day from morning to evening, using Workpath all along the way to get their work done. I committed to delivering some wires, mostly as a way to organize the story on the page.</p>

      <p>To kick off a major redesign at Workpath, I took a hands-on approachâ€”designing in code and crafting an extensive high-fidelity moodboard. Using insights from the team and an understanding of the current site's strengths and weaknesses, I revisited every design element, from "perfect world" homepages to marketing components. Simultaneously, I revamped the Workpath brand, selecting new typefaces and colors that better represented its evolving identity. This effort culminated in "Housecall," a design kit guiding subsequent visual design work.</p>

      <p>I crafted both the homepage and the "Platform" page to complement each other, establishing the brand and guiding the reader through a typical workday in the Workpath app. The revitalized brand and marketing efforts led to Workpath's acquisition by Ro, underscoring the impact that rebranding and replatforming can have on a conceptually strong business in need of a bit more visibility.</p>
